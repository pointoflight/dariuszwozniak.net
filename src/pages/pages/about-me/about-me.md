Hi there!

I'm Vedant Chavda, a 3rd year Computer Science undergrad (class of 2022) at BITS Pilani. 

I worked as a research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in the Real Time Systems Group, on formal analysis of real-time operating systems. You can visit my [GitLab profile](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/pointoflight) to take a look at my work.


I also spent my summer of 2020 doing machine learning research at CSIR-CEERI, focusing on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for medical imaging applications.
